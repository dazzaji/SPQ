# Generative AI: The Technology

* What the technology is and how it's different
* Why that matters for purposes of using it as part of law practice 

## Old Way is to Query:

* Boolean/Regex/SQL: These are structured query languages or patterns used to retrieve information from databases or search through text based on specific conditions or patterns.

* Limited to Explicit Matches: They usually lack the capability to understand the contextual or semantic meaning of words and are limited to finding explicit matches or patterns in the data.

## New Way is to Prompt:

* Fundamentally, the model predicts the best next word. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Language models like GPT-4 process and understand natural language input, meaning they interpret the contextual and semantic meaning of words and sentences, rather than just matching keywords or patterns.

* Each word or phrase as represented by a pattern formed by a set of points (the values in the vector) across multiple dimensions (features or aspects of the word or phrase).

## Notice How This is Like Human Interaction

* Semantic Similarity in High Dimensional Vector Space: These models operate by encoding words and sentences as points in high-dimensional vectors and computing semantic similarities between them. They leverage this approach to generate coherent, contextually relevant responses based on the input provided.

* User Interaction: Users interact with these models using natural language, which is more intuitive and user-friendly compared to formulating structured queries or using specific syntax.

## What does this mean for professionals services?

* An electric blender vs a Star Trek replicator
* Opportunity to identify concepts across contexts
* Current uses for improving existing work of the Service Line
* Exploration of how the technology could eventually transform the nature of the Service Line

Notes - Reflection on the explanation of “points” in vector space:

Fingerprints as an analogy aligns well with how words or phrases are represented in models like GPT-4. A finger print is itself matched based on a number of points of concordance along it's unique lines.  In fact, many examiners conclude a crime scene print came from a suspect after matching between three and sixteen points of concordance (FBI examiners found 15 points on defendant Mayfield's print, for example). But there are no standards on the number of points that must be matched, and the pattern though present may not reveal a factual truth (eg https://www.bu.edu/sjmag/scimag2005/opinion/fingerprints.htm).

You can think of each word or phrase as being represented by a pattern formed by a set of points (the values in the vector) across multiple dimensions (features or aspects of the word or phrase).

Elaboration: Each word or phrase is represented by a vector in high-dimensional space. This vector consists of multiple values (or coordinates), with each value corresponding to a different feature or aspect of the word or phrase, representing a different dimension in the space. Together, all of these values (or points) form a unique pattern that represents the semantic meaning of the word or phrase in this multi-dimensional space.

When we refer to a "point" in high-dimensional space representing a word or phrase, it's a simplification. It's more accurate to say that the entire vector—a collection of many points or values across different dimensions—represents the word or phrase, and the pattern formed by these values in the high-dimensional space is unique to the semantic meaning of that word or phrase.

Simplified Explanation: Imagine every word or phrase is like a unique snowflake. Each snowflake has a unique pattern formed by the arrangement of its ice crystals. In this analogy, each ice crystal is like a value in the vector, and the unique pattern they form is like the representation of the word or phrase in high-dimensional space. When we compare two snowflakes, we compare their patterns, much like comparing the semantic similarity of words or phrases based on their vector representations in high-dimensional space.
